# pacmen
Are you missing Pacman? You can now create your own pack (or is it Pac?) of Pacmen.

## How to Run

1. Download the repository or clone it to your local machine
2. Open [index.html](./index.html)
3. Click on the `Start Game` button
4. The game has now started. To create a new Pacman, click on the `Add PacMan` button. Every time you click this button, a new PacMan with a random velocity (but always in the positive X direction) will be created.

## Roadmap of future improvements

- Allowing the user to tune velocity and position parameters
- Modeling collisions between the PacMen (complexity - high)
- Modeling physical properties of the ecosystem like gravity and elasticity of the PacMan
- Improving the user interface
